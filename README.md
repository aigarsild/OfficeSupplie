# OfficeSupplie
OfficeSupplie prototype

## Design
Design was done based on wireframes provided by the client.
Software used for the design was Sketch.

I changed the position of product actions and product images that was provided on the wireframes.
The reason is because the add to cart button would have stayed outside the screen while the user is scrolling to the picture.
So the user would have to scroll back up for add to cart button, this will break the flow of the user.

I also inserted all the cart data inside a minicart to not clutter the header.
### Research
Desk research was done, mostly analysing competitive companies product pages.
### Color scheme
Main action color used was from the logo - pink (#ED2B91). 
Three main colors have been used #ED2B91, #333333, #E4E4E4, #D8D8D8.
### Font
Font used is a web safe font from Google - Montserrat https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat
### Interaction design
Some transitions have been used for moving elements.
Add to cart effect will draw attention to the cart.
### Method
Mobile first approach

## Development
Development tools were HTML5, CSS3, jQuery 
Initializr (http://www.initializr.com/) is a HTML5 boilerplate for easy starting a project.
ResponsiveSlides.js (http://responsiveslides.com/) is a lightweight slider plugin.
GIT for version control.

Jquery is a huge library to add to a such a small project but eventually if it will grow into a bigger one it will be better to have it from early on.

### Method
Mobile first development.
I wrote most of the elements keeping in mind that it will be easy to reuse or extend them.
For example toggle function can be used anywhere on the site by adding correct classnames to elements.

### Fixes for next version
For a bigger size project it will be better to create more global elements that can be placed anywhere on the site without writing more css or js.
